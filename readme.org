* Supported grammar
The Prunt g-code parser only accepts a limited grammar that is commonly generated by 3D printing slicers.
Specifically:

- If a line contains any words then it must contain exactly one G or M word.
- A line must not contain duplicate words (i.e. =G0 X1 X2= or =G0 X1 X1=).
- Only spaces may be used between words.
- Spaces are optional.
- Spaces are not allowed in the middle of words (i.e. =G 0=).
- The only allowed format for words is =[a-zA-Z]-?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]*=.
- When a word in a command expects an integer (as listed below), a decimal point may not be present.
- Only numbers in the range 0..999 are considered to be integers, all other values are floats.
- Words may be on any order on a line and all orders are equivalent.

* Commands
Optional values are in square brackets. =-= represents a integer or float. =#= represents an integer.

* Notes for developers
- The parser does not enforce limits, it simply outputs them and leaves it up to the caller.
